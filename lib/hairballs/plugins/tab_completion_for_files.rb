require_relative '../../hairballs'

# Adds the ability to tab-complete files that are in the current directory.
#
# Example:
#
#     # If in the hairballs project root, doing this...
#     irb> File.read("READâ‡¥
#     # Will complete like this...
#     irb> File.read("README.md"
#
# The +completion_append_character+ is really a Readline option that tells it
# what to do when you tab-complete a term. It's set to not add anything to the
# completed term, but you may find it suits you better to append a single space.
